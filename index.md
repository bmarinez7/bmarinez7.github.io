### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was really cool, because I was able to create a blackjack game by writing code. At first I was confused on how I would approach this, but in the end I managed to create a working game. The introduction to functions became really helpful in this lab, because I could write the function once and call it instead of writing it all over again whenever it was needed.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was fun to me, because I was able to create my first image using color gradients in my code. It was exciting to learn how to use the Magick::Color to add these color gradients. In addition, the use of functions also helped me understand exactly how to implement them into the main function, which was something I was confused on in the beginning.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was also fun to do because not only did it use knowledge from lab 10, but it also had new parts to it like making random color pixels to create a noisy background. I learned how to create a .gif file in this lab and how to add text to this gif file. Overall, I feel like this Lab really captured my interest in coding and I hope to do more with this.
